First, import the u.data file using MATLAB. 
Each column of data stored as VarName1, VarName2, VarName3, VarName4 in the workspace

The code is broken into cells that should be run in order.
-in some cells, manually change value of some variable, i.e. k=10,50,100

There are 2 script files
-p3.m is for parts 1-3
-p3_2.m is for parts 4-5

There are 2 function files
-wnmfrule_4 runs the weighted NMF on the weights of the standard R matrix
-wnmfrule_reg runs the weighted regularized NMF on the weights of the standard R matrix

Make sure the linked NMF toolbox is accessible to use wnmfrule
