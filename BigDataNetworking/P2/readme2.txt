The code files are all named "p2_", where the _ represents which parts are implemented in the file.
All coding was done in Python using Spyder

The variable space can be reset using %reset after each file is run if desired.

The code is broken into cells; it is recommended to run the cells separately
-there may be some leftover test cells

p2bc.py
-at the end, manually change the class_index to determine which category is processed
