Part 1 was completed in Python (p4_1.py)
-run cells in order, make sure data can be imported properly

Part 2-3: Python and R (p4_2.py, p4_3.py, p4_2_LR.R, p4_3_LR.R)
-compile data in python and then export to R
-comment/uncomment to determine which dataset to use
-change name of exported .csv file as needed
-for part 3, process data in python, run regression in R to find top 3 features, then plot in python
--move on to next hashtag after scatterplots are created

Part 4: Python (p4_41.py, p4_42.py)
-first file: 10-fold cross validation for entire time periods
-second file: 10-fold CVs for the 3 periods
-change data file opened to change between hashtags

Part 5: Python (p4_5.py)
-load data and specify period to calculate and save models one at a time
-test each sample to determine which model to use

Part 6: Python and R (p4_6.py, p4_6_R.R)
-Load data in Python, analysis in R like in parts 2-3

Overall summary
-comment/uncomment to select which datasets to process
-save data matrices as .csv for exporting to R for linear model analysis
