knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
*Note: eval set to False in some segments as modeling was done using a script, so results were already obtained prior. Pictures of relevant outputs are included instead. Re-computation would take an excessive amount of time. Set eval to true to run from scratch.*

## Introduction

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a U.S. government agency responsible for protecting consumers from unfair treatment by financial institutions (banks, lenders, etc.) 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many institutions to publicly disclose mortgage data to the public. Data is available on their website at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(stringr)
library(writexl)
library(caret)
library(mice)

setwd("E:/Extension/DSI/Capstone")
```

## Data Acquisition 

Data from 2007-2017 available for download on the website. It is available in both encoded
and plain language forms. To save memory and processing power, use only the encoded data and consult the code explanation sheet to interpret the results.

Download and analyze the 2017 data for now. If another year is desired, then simply change the file to be loaded.

```{r, message=FALSE}
data_all <- fread("hmda_2017_nationwide_all-records_codes.csv")
```
```{r}
colnames(data_all)
str(data_all)
summary(data_all)
```

## Data Cleaning

Lots of features to manage. Discard features where they were all NA (edit_status, sequence_number, application_date_indicator), all the same (as_of_year), and ID (respondent_id).

```{r}
hmda <- subset(data_all,select=-c(as_of_year,respondent_id,edit_status,
                                  sequence_number,application_date_indicator))
rm(data_all)
```

Not all applications featured a co-applicant. In addition, a large majority of people only listed 1 race.

```{r}
# 8 = no co-applicant
table(hmda$co_applicant_race_1)

# View % of (co)applicants who are multiracial
sum(table(hmda$co_applicant_race_2))/nrow(hmda)
sum(table(hmda$applicant_race_2))/nrow(hmda)
```

Create new Boolean features for whether applicant was multiracial and whether application had a co-applicant. 
Also, take Action Taken as the feature to extract the future dependent variable from. Action taken is encoded as follows:

Code | Meaning 
-----| ---------- 
1    | Loan Originated      
2    | Application approved but not accepted
3    | Application denied by financial institution        
4    | Application withdrawn by applicant
5    | File closed for incompleteness        
6    | Loan purchased by institution
7    | Preapproval request denied        
8    | Preapproval request approved but not accepted

Group actions 1,2, and 8 as "Approved" (1), else "Not approved" (0), creating a new binary feature.

```{r}
hmda$multirace <- ifelse(!is.na(hmda$applicant_race_2),yes=1,no=0)
hmda$coapplicant <- ifelse(hmda$co_applicant_race_1==8,yes=0,no=1)
hmda$approved <- ifelse((hmda$action_taken %in% c(1,2,8) ),yes=1,no=0)
```

Since a lot of the features are actually encoded factors, set said features as factors:

```{r}
factorcols <- colnames(hmda)
factorcols <- factorcols[!factorcols %in% c("loan_amount_000s","applicant_income_000s","population",
                                            "minority_population","hud_median_family_income",
                                            "tract_to_msamd_income","number_of_owner_occupied_units",
                                            "number_of_1_to_4_family_units","rate_spread")]
hmda[,(factorcols):= lapply(.SD, as.factor), .SDcols = factorcols]

str(hmda)
summary(hmda)
```

## EDA

Proceed with some EDA:

  ylim(c(0,150))
```

It does appear that different values within some features affect the approval rates.

Action 6 seems out of place. It represents transactions involving a loan being sold from one institution to another, not new mortgage applications. So removing them is prudent.

```{r}

Upon further inspection, action 4 could also be removed, as they represent instances where the applicant(s) took themselves out of consideration.

Now there certainly appears that some features may influence the mortgage approval rates.

The state and county codes are included with the data. They can be converted into FIPS codes. The data can then be exported to Tableau to create a graphical map.

```{r}
hmda_reduced$state_code <- str_pad(hmda_reduced$state_code, 2, pad = "0")
hmda_reduced$county_code <- str_pad(hmda_reduced$county_code, 3, pad = "0")

hmda_reduced$fips <- paste0(hmda_reduced$state_code,hmda_reduced$county_code)
hmda_reduced$fips <- as.factor(hmda_reduced$fips)

str(hmda_reduced)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(hmda_reduced,"testcs.csv")
```

Lastly, produce a few plots showing the relationship between applicant income and race/ethnicity/sex:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(hmda_reduced, aes(x=applicant_race_1, y=applicant_income_000s, fill=applicant_race_1)) + 
  geom_violin()+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill="white") + 
  labs(x="Applicant Race",y="Income in 1000s",title="2017 Race/Income Plot") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
        legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  ylim(c(0,250))

ggplot(hmda_reduced, aes(x=applicant_sex, y=applicant_income_000s, fill=applicant_sex)) + 
  geom_violin()+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill="white") + 
  labs(x="Applicant Sex",y="Income in 1000s",title="2017 Sex/Income Plot") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
        legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  ylim(c(0,250))

ggplot(hmda_reduced, aes(x=applicant_ethnicity, y=applicant_income_000s, fill=applicant_ethnicity)) + 
  geom_violin()+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill="white") + 
  labs(x="Applicant Ethnicity",y="Income in 1000s",title="2017 Ethnicity/Income Plot") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
        legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  ylim(c(0,250))
```

## Data Cleaning

There are still a lot of features. Some more of them can be removed.

Remove denial reason(s), since you cannot have a reason unless application was rejected; even in those cases many rejections had no denial reasons listed. Additionally, some features had many values that were NA or were almost all the same value; those can also be dropped.

Due to performance/hardware constraints, categorical features with many different factors need to also be dropped. FIPS is dropped, for example, but the numerical features based on location remain. 10.5 million observations is still excessive, so take a 1 million observation subset to start with.

```{r}
hmda_ml <- subset(hmda_reduced, select=-c(denial_reason_1,denial_reason_2,denial_reason_3,
                                        rate_spread,msamd,census_tract_number))
str(hmda_ml)
summary(hmda_ml)

# Very long computational time, unfortunately remove features with large # of factors
# Also hoepa_status, which is almost always 2
hmda_ml <- subset(hmda_ml, select=-c(state_code,county_code,fips,hoepa_status))

set.seed(1)
hmda_ml <- hmda_ml[sample(.N,1000000)]
# write.csv(hmda_ml,"testset1.csv")
# hmda_ml <- fread("testset1.csv")
# hmda_ml$V1 <- NULL

str(hmda_ml)
summary(hmda_ml)
rm(hmda_reduced)
```

### Imputation

There are still NA values remaining in the data. Visualize and impute the missing data with mice library, before exporting to CSV for easy access:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
md.pattern(hmda_ml,rotate.names = TRUE)
hmda_fill <- complete(mice(hmda_ml, maxit = 1))
write.csv(hmda_fill,"testset1_imp.csv")
```
